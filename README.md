# My journey on Artificial Intelligence
Notes and notebooks I'll take during my study journey on Artificial Intelligence topics

## Credits

There many difference source of inspiration from all those files. I'll try to keep all the credits here

I'm currently taking notes and creating notebook while studying the **Machine Learning Masterclass** [by datamasters](https://datamasters.it/), that has honestly been **one of the biggest step I've done during my AI studyng journey**. 

So most of the notebooks, the notes, and the exercise have been highly inspired by their materials.

Many thanks to [@aintzillo](https://github.com/aintzillo), [@giuseppemastrandrea](https://github.com/giuseppemastrandrea) and [@frankhood](https://github.com/frankhood) for the way they teach and for all the support along the way

[FastAI's courses](https://www.fast.ai/) have been a big sources of inspiration, and extremly usefull materials, especially in my first days studying AI.

In particoular 

- _002 - Linear Regression / 00 - Various / MINST_solo_con_tensori_no_ai.ipynb_ has been created from an excercise in the book _[Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD_ by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527)_

Many thanks to [@fastai](https://github.com/fastai) for all the free materials
