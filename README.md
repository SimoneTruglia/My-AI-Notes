# My journey on Artificial Intelligence
Notes and notebooks I'll take during my study journey on Artificial Intelligence topics

# Credits

I'm currently taking notes and creating notebook while studying the Machine Learning Masterclass [by datamasters](https://datamasters.it/), that has honestly been one of the biggest step I've done during my AI studyng journey. 

So most of the notebooks, the notes, and the exercise have been highly inspired by their material

There many difference source of inspiration from all those files. I'll try to keep all the credits here

Canal Sandeco on YouTube has been a great source of inspiration, especially [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbmt8d_ueDMVUVlw9VZSdgAIi6W3u-7Zg)

[FastAI's courses](https://www.fast.ai/) have been a big sources of inspiration, and extremly usefull materials, especially in my first days studying AI.

002 - Linear Regression / 00 - Various / MINST_solo_con_tensori_no_ai.ipynb
File has been created from an excercise in the book "Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD" by them


Other files can have various other inspiration sources, one of them is surely the course I'm doing with datamasters.it
