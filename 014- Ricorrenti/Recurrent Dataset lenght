Note that:

- len(ORIGINAL) = 10 
- len(RECURRENT) = 8
- x1, x2, [x3] represent a single series for the recurrent network, where xi is a a different value of the feature x at the istant t and [x3] is the label of the series

x[N-T+1], ..., xN

Note that

- len(ORIGINAL) = N
- len(RECURRENT) = N-T+1

and so we have that in general 

len(RECURRENT) = len(ORIGINAL) - T + 1
